Description: RNASeqBits is a package that contains a variety of functions or operations that I frequently use when processing RNAseq data in R. This inlcudes data filtering, TPM calculations, heatmap plotting and more.  Note that some functions require input from a specific package, so must be formatted in a specific way. I've tried to explain these requirements in the function documentation.
